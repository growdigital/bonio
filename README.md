# Bonio â€” Hugo barebones skeleton site

## About

[Hugo](http://gohugo.io) is a fantastic Static Site Generator. This is a the barest of Hugo sites, including a theme called `gobonio`, to help me see where all the moving (sic) parts are.

## Usage

1. [Install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/)
3. ```git clone git@github.com:growdigital/bonio.git```
4. ```cd bonio```
5. ```hugo serve```

Based in part on Vimux's [blank theme](https://github.com/Vimux/blank/)
